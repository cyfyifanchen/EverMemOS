class DocumentBaseWithSoftDelete(DocumentBase):
    """
    Base document class with soft delete functionality

    Inherits from DocumentBase, integrating complete soft delete capabilities:
    - Provides full soft delete capability (self-implemented, not relying on beanie's DocumentWithSoftDelete)
    - Supports timezone-aware datetime handling (from DocumentBase)
    - Supports database binding configuration (from DocumentBase)
    - Supports audit field handling during bulk insert (from DocumentBase)
    - **Extended deletion audit fields: deleted_by (deleter) and deleted_id (uniqueness trick)**
    - **Complete bulk soft delete support**

    Soft delete field descriptions:
        - deleted_at: deletion timestamp
        - deleted_by: identifier of the deletion operator
        - deleted_id: deletion identifier ID, used for unique index trick
          * When not deleted: deleted_id = 0 (all undeleted documents share this value)
          * When deleted: deleted_id = hash value of the document's _id
          * Advantage: can create unique index on (business field + deleted_id), achieving:
            - Only one record allowed for the same business key when undeleted
            - Multiple historical records allowed for the same business key after deletion
            - New records with the same business key can be inserted after soft deletion

    Core methods:
        Instance methods:
        - delete(): soft delete current document
        - restore(): restore a deleted document
        - hard_delete(): hard delete current document (physical deletion)
        - is_deleted(): check if document is deleted

        Class methods (queries):
        - find_one(): find one document (automatically filters out deleted ones)
        - find_many(): find multiple documents (automatically filters out deleted ones)
        - hard_find_one(): hard find one document (including deleted ones)
        - hard_find_many(): hard find multiple documents (including deleted ones)

        Class methods (bulk operations):
        - delete_many(): bulk soft delete
        - restore_many(): bulk restore
        - hard_delete_many(): bulk hard delete

        Utility methods (for native pymongo API):
        - apply_soft_delete_filter(): apply soft delete filter condition to query
        - get_soft_delete_filter(): get pure soft delete filter condition

    Important notes:
        ⚠️ Do not use Model.find().delete_many(), it performs hard deletion!
        Use Model.delete_many(filter) to perform bulk soft deletion.

    Usage example:
        from pydantic import Field

        Hard find multiple documents (including those soft deleted)

        Unlike find_many(), this method does not filter out deleted documents.
        Used in scenarios requiring viewing history or restoring deleted documents.
        Naming is consistent with hard_delete.
